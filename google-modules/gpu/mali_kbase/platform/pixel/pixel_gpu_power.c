 * the GPU comes on again we can indicate to the core Mali driver that the GPU state needs to be
 * reconstructed. See the documentation for &gpu_pm_callback_power_suspend for more information.
 *
 * Since all power operations are handled in the most aggressive manner, &power_resume_callback, is

 *
 * For runtime PM operations, we use virtual devices mapped to the two GPU power domains (TOP and

 * define these as they link initialization in this file with the probe of the GPU device.
